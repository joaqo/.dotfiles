My name is Joaquín Alori, I am a developer from Uruguay, working on several projects.
The biggest project I'm working on now is Mellow, and this is the one I'll usually be refering to if I don't specify.
In all interactions and commit messages, be extremely concise and sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.

## Projects
- Mellow: Food ecommerce app (~/mellow/)

## Workflow
- Editor: nvim
- Terminal: tmux
- Shell: bash
- Secondary editor: Zed (vim mode, Claude + Firebase MCP)

## Dotfiles
Dotfiles versioned in `~/.dotfiles/` project and symlinked to home. When I ask you to modify something about my workflow or, how something on my workflow works, go to the directories listed below, so you can see exactly what my os (macOS) is seeing. 

# Notion
When I tell you to create tasks, create it in Notion. If I don't specify any of these task properties, default to:
- Status: "Pending"
- Assignee: Joaquín Alori
- Due date: (none)
