My name is Joaquín Alori, I am a developer from Uruguay, working on several projects.

The biggest project I'm working on now is Mellow, and this is the one I'll usually be refering to if I don't specify.

I also have a ~/.dotfiles project, where I version most of the config files in my machine.
Stuff in ~ like .bashrc, .claude/, .config, etc.
Most of these configs are just symlinks to their version on ~/.dotfiles, so whenever I ask you to modify some config
like this on my OS, first check if its in my dotfiles

In all interactions and commit messages, be extremely concise and sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.

## Workflow
