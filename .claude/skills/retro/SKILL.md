We're done with the task. Take a step back and reflect:

Knowing everything you know now — the root cause, the codebase structure, the gotchas you hit, any wrong turns you took — what would have been the most elegant and simplest way to solve this from the start?

Be concise. Focus on what you'd do differently, not on rehashing what happened.
