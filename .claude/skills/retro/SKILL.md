description: Retrospective — reflect on the work done, then clean up the solution
---

Ok, you found a working solution! Knowing what you know now, what would you have done differently?

Suggestions:
- Now that we know the root cause of the issue we could re write the solution to be simpler?
- Opportunities for refactor?
- Debugging code to clean up?
- Did you write code that typically already exists in large codebases like ours and could be a duplicate of that? Feel free to explore codebase looking for this if you think its likely.

You are free to think and explore as much as you want, but only communicate to me things that are relevant, do not show me your thought process. If there is nothing to do just say so. Be as terse as possible in your response.
